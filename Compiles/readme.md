If you already have PICOPi installed, then you should be able to unzip this over it. You will need to modify the wpa_supplicant.conf file with your information. it will be picked up at boot and *should* connect to your WiFi. ;-)

i usually set up my phone to be a HotSpot so i can see it connect.

i've been testing it quite a bit and haven't had any issues, but YMMV.

let me know what you think.

Guillermo Amaral a fanstastic job of putting all of this together, all i did was hack in some WiFi and made some tweaks here and there.
